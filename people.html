                <p>Michael is interested in understanding the neural population inferring the world when an agent is foraging/hunting in interactive and dynamic environments.
                Michael got his B.S in biomedical science and psychology at Handong University.
                He obtained his Ph.D. in neuroscience from the University of Minnesota (Advisor: Dr. Benjamin Hayden)
                and subsequently did his postdoc at Massachusetts Institution of Technology (Advisor: Dr. Mehrdad Jazayeri).
