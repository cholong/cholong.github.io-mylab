        The kind of research we do requires a lot of teamwork, and we love working with people who are generous with their time, expertise, and creativity.
        There are also a few practical skills that would make you stand out as an applicant, but these are not strictly required.
        Our ideal candidates know some math and have done some programming.
        Does not have to be a formal degree but active self-studying on Coursera or other online sources can compensate for it
        (actually we value self-learning ability!). Also, a person who is not afraid of working with an animal will have a great time with us.
        Ultimately, we want a good citizen who values other people regardless of the background. This includes gender, ethnicity, religion, age, and others.
        If you are interested in a postdoc, graduate degree, or undergraduate internship, please <a id="mail" href="mailto:sbyoo.skku.bme@gmail.com">contact Michael Yoo</a>.
